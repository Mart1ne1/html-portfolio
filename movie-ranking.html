<h2>My Top Movies of 2024</h2>

<h3>Dune 2</h3>
<p>This was the movie of the year for me with the best storyline, plot, sci-fi and character build up.</p>
<h3>Deadpool vs Wolverine</h3>
<p>I had waited for this one eagerly and it did not dissapoint. Very comical with great characters and awesome action scenes.</p>
<h3>Kraven the Hunter</h3>
<p>I enjoyed this one even though it had mixed reviews. The plot felt a little rushed but the action scenes and the storyline made up for it.</p>
